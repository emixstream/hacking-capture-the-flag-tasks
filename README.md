# hacking-capture-the-flag-tasks

here some ctf tasks on various subject, from decryption task on weird alphanumeric stuff, to image analysis.

You will find some python some js basic code and some old school asm of course.
But you can go along mostly with your linux command line :)

Some taks are really hard and I personally couldn't manage it, other are easy, if you find the right logic at a glance.

Enjoy it!! :)
